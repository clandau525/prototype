# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The file upload system is the foundational feature for the underwriting platform that enables users to submit documents for analysis and processing. This system will serve as the entry point for deal flow documentation, allowing businesses to upload financial statements, legal documents, and other materials required for underwriting evaluation. The system must handle multiple file types, provide secure storage, and integrate with the platform's document processing pipeline.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a business seeking capital, I want to upload multiple documents at once, so that I can efficiently submit all required materials for underwriting review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the upload interface THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop upload area
2. WHEN a user drags files over the upload area THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the drop zone is active
3. WHEN a user drops multiple files THEN the system SHALL accept and queue all files for upload simultaneously
4. WHEN files are being uploaded THEN the system SHALL display individual progress indicators for each file
5. IF the total file size exceeds 100MB THEN the system SHALL display a warning message and allow the user to proceed or remove files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to upload various document types, so that I can submit all necessary materials regardless of format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats
2. IF a user attempts to upload an unsupported file type THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the file
3. WHEN a supported file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file integrity and format
4. IF a file is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide guidance on resolution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want uploaded files to be securely stored and organized, so that I can ensure data protection and easy retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in encrypted cloud storage
2. WHEN a file is stored THEN the system SHALL generate a unique identifier and maintain metadata including filename, size, upload timestamp, and user ID
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL organize them by user session and timestamp
4. WHEN file storage occurs THEN the system SHALL implement virus scanning before final storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of my uploads and manage uploaded files, so that I can track progress and make corrections if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploading THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress with percentage completion
2. WHEN an upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success confirmation with file details
3. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry
4. WHEN uploads are complete THEN the system SHALL provide a list of uploaded files with options to preview or remove
5. IF a user wants to remove a file THEN the system SHALL allow deletion with confirmation prompt

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the upload system to trigger downstream processing, so that uploaded documents can be automatically analyzed and categorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL emit an event to the document processing pipeline
2. WHEN the processing event is triggered THEN the system SHALL include file metadata and storage location
3. WHEN multiple files are uploaded in a session THEN the system SHALL group them as a submission batch
4. IF downstream processing fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the uploaded files and allow reprocessing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the upload process to be resilient to network issues, so that I don't lose progress on large file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network interruption occurs during upload THEN the system SHALL attempt to resume the upload automatically
2. WHEN an upload is interrupted THEN the system SHALL maintain partial upload state for up to 24 hours
3. WHEN a user returns after interruption THEN the system SHALL offer to resume incomplete uploads
4. IF an upload cannot be resumed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to restart with clear messaging
