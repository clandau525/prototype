# Design Document

## Overview

The file upload system is designed as a robust, scalable solution that serves as the entry point for document submission in the underwriting platform. The system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns between the frontend upload interface, backend processing services, and storage infrastructure. The design emphasizes security, reliability, and user experience while providing seamless integration with downstream document processing workflows.

## Architecture

The file upload system consists of four main architectural layers:

**Presentation Layer**: A responsive web interface built with modern JavaScript frameworks, providing drag-and-drop functionality, progress tracking, and file management capabilities.

**API Gateway Layer**: A RESTful API service that handles upload requests, authentication, validation, and coordinates with backend services.

**Processing Layer**: Background services responsible for file validation, virus scanning, metadata extraction, and event publishing.

**Storage Layer**: Cloud-based object storage with encryption at rest, organized hierarchically by user sessions and timestamps.

The system uses an event-driven architecture where successful uploads trigger events for downstream processing, ensuring loose coupling with the broader platform ecosystem.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Upload Component

**Purpose**: Provides the user interface for file selection, upload progress tracking, and file management.

**Key Features**:
- Drag-and-drop upload zone with visual feedback
- Multi-file selection and batch upload capabilities
- Real-time progress indicators with pause/resume functionality
- File preview and management interface
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

**Technology Stack**: React.js with TypeScript, using libraries like react-dropzone for file handling and axios for HTTP requests.

### Upload API Service

**Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests for file uploads, implements business logic, and coordinates with backend services.

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/upload/initiate` - Initiates upload session and returns upload URLs
- `POST /api/v1/upload/chunk` - Handles chunked file uploads for large files
- `GET /api/v1/upload/status/{uploadId}` - Returns upload progress and status
- `DELETE /api/v1/upload/{fileId}` - Removes uploaded files
- `GET /api/v1/upload/session/{sessionId}` - Lists files in upload session

**Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js framework, implementing JWT authentication and rate limiting.

### File Processing Service

**Purpose**: Validates uploaded files, performs security scanning, and extracts metadata.

**Responsibilities**:
- File format validation and integrity checking
- Virus and malware scanning using cloud-based security services
- Metadata extraction (file size, type, creation date, etc.)
- Thumbnail generation for supported image formats
- Event publishing to message queue for downstream processing

**Technology Stack**: Python with FastAPI, integrating with cloud security services and message brokers.

### Storage Service

**Purpose**: Manages secure file storage with encryption and organized hierarchy.

**Features**:
- Encrypted storage using AES-256 encryption
- Hierarchical organization by user/session/timestamp
- Automatic backup and versioning
- Integration with CDN for fast file retrieval
- Lifecycle management for temporary files

**Technology Stack**: AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage with server-side encryption enabled.

## Data Models

### Upload Session Model
```typescript
interface UploadSession {
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'expired';
  totalFiles: number;
  totalSize: number;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### File Upload Model
```typescript
interface FileUpload {
  fileId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  originalName: string;
  storagePath: string;
  mimeType: string;
  fileSize: number;
  uploadedAt: Date;
  status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  checksum: string;
  metadata: {
    dimensions?: { width: number; height: number };
    pageCount?: number;
    extractedText?: string;
  };
}
```

### Upload Progress Model
```typescript
interface UploadProgress {
  fileId: string;
  bytesUploaded: number;
  totalBytes: number;
  percentage: number;
  speed: number; // bytes per second
  estimatedTimeRemaining: number; // seconds
  status: 'pending' | 'uploading' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'error';
  errorMessage?: string;
}
```

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

**Client-Side Error Handling**:
- Network connectivity issues with automatic retry logic
- File validation errors with user-friendly messages
- Upload interruption handling with resume capabilities
- Browser compatibility checks and fallbacks

**Server-Side Error Handling**:
- Request validation with detailed error responses
- File processing errors with categorized error codes
- Storage service failures with automatic failover
- Rate limiting and quota enforcement

**Error Response Format**:
```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: Date;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Frontend components tested with Jest and React Testing Library
- API endpoints tested with comprehensive request/response scenarios
- File processing logic tested with various file types and edge cases
- Storage operations tested with mocked cloud services

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end upload workflows tested across all system components
- Error handling scenarios tested with simulated failures
- Performance testing with large files and concurrent uploads
- Security testing including file validation and virus scanning

### Load Testing
- Concurrent upload testing with multiple users
- Large file upload testing (up to 100MB per file)
- System resource monitoring during peak loads
- Database performance testing with high file volumes

### Security Testing
- File upload vulnerability testing (malicious files, oversized files)
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Data encryption verification
- API security testing including injection attacks

The testing strategy ensures the system meets all functional requirements while maintaining security and performance standards under various load conditions.
